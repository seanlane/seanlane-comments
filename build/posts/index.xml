      <title>Snippets for Markdown to LaTeX with Pandoc</title>

      <description>This is another living post that serves more for my personal benefit than anything else. By living, I mean that I will continue to update it over time as I find things I want to keep easily accessible. This post is a place to paste snippets and boiler plate of Markdown/Pandoc/LaTeX material that I find useful but often forget. There&amp;rsquo;s probably nothing very genius or awe-inspiring here, but hopefully I won&amp;rsquo;t have to grep through by bash history as often, trying to remember what I did that one time to do that one thing.</description>

      <description>Relating to my previous post today about setting up a blog using AWS, Docker Compose, Caddy Server, and Ghost, I found the need to do some web scraping. A number of years ago, my wife began journaling her thoughts in an online service called LDSJournal.com (at least I believe that was the name). About 2 years ago, this service was acquired by a new site called jrnl.com. It seems to be a fairly neat service, but one thing we were concerned with is preserving the data should the account ever disappear.</description>

      <description>*Not including the domain name, of course. Also, this makes use of the portion Amazon AWS Free Tier that expires after 12 months, so only really free for that time. Should continue to be very inexpensive, though.
My wife previously utilized an online service to host a private journal, which has since been acquired. She wanted to switch to something else, and after scraping the new service which lacks a proper API or export functionality, we needed something else for her to use.</description>

      <title>Notes from Deep Work by Cal Newport</title>

      <description>The following are some notes that I&amp;rsquo;ve gathered after reading Deep Work by Cal Newport. I enjoyed the book, felt it has some concepts I want to apply in my life, so I condensed the precepts I wanted to remember into a form that would fit onto a single sheet of US letter paper. A link to that PDF can be found here: Deep Work Notes PDF

      <description>The following is mostly for my own personal reference. About 5 years ago, I worked as a technical support agent for a fairly large webhosting company that used to be located in Utah, and at the time I kept a small Wordpress site with some tips or code snippets that often came in handy. I was cleaning out soem old files, and came across the SQL dump of that site when I left that job.</description>

      <guid>https://sean.lane.sh/posts/2018/07/Home-backup-strategy/</guid>
      <description>TL;DR: CrashPlan died in May 2018, so I switched my family over to using Duplicati, restic, and rclone to sync backups both locally and in the cloud. As a bonus, we&amp;rsquo;re doing for free for the next year with Google Cloud Storage due to their 12 month, $300 free trial.
Motivation For the past two years or so from the date of this post, I&amp;rsquo;ve had my family using a piece of software known as CrashPlan for backing up all of the computers for my family, my siblings and their families, and my parents.</description>

      <description>Another quick post, but something that I hope might be useful to others. Within the past couple weeks, my grandmother of 83 years passed away and my family held a memorial service in her honor. I was asked if I could help out in creating a program booklet or pamphlet that could be given out to the attendees, something that would describe the service itself as well as share a piece of my grandmother&amp;rsquo;s life with them as we gathered to remember her.</description>

      <title>Dynamic weight tracking form and dashboard</title>

      <description>This is a quick post, but if you want a quick way to track body weight, or any metric you choose, and have an automatically updating dashboard, this is it. I used Google Forms to easy record the information and then this information is read by a Google Apps Script that generates a chart with Chart.js.
  Example Screenshot
  I roughly followed the instruction found here by Ben Collins: Creating a d3 chart with data from Google Sheets.</description>

      <title>Dynamically updating Matplotlib figures in Jupyter notebooks</title>

      <description>Updating matplotlib figures dynamically seems to be a bit of a hassle, but the code below seems to do the trick. This is an example that outputs a figure with multiple subplots, each with multiple plots. Oddly enough, at the time of writing the image will be smaller than the figure until the Jupyter cells stops running, but this can be fixed but generating the figure in one cell, and then updating the image in a subsequent cell 1.</description>

      <description>A lot of my lab work and course work involved the use of Jupyter notebooks, though the Python dependencies needed conflict with other areas. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using virtualenvwrapper to isolate these, and other project, environments from each other. This post goes through the process of installing everything needed to get up and running with a clean Python environment for Jupyter notebooks with separate kernels for each environment, including the installation of jupyter_contrib_nbextensions which adds community developed features.</description>

      <guid>https://sean.lane.sh/posts/2018/01/Installing-Arch-Linux-on-a-Microsoft-Surface-3/</guid>
      <description>A few years ago, I was given a Microsoft Surface 3 tablet that has since fallen into disuse. I was appreciative of the gift, though to be honest the Intel Atom CPU it came with is fairly underpowered when it comes to running Windows 10, so I decided to install a light Linux distro on it to get the tablet back into running order. I came across the blog post Running Arch Linux on a Surface 3 by Chad Voegele, which was fairly useful in getting started, and I wanted to write a post of my own to share some addition details and places where I diverged from Chad&amp;rsquo;s post along the way.</description>

      <description>This post is not about technology, computer science, or programming. Instead it&amp;rsquo;s a call back to my time as an LDS missionary in Paraguay. During my time there, I came across a talk given by an Elder Lawrence Corbridge that I really enjoyed. Some friends of mine were asking about it, and I wanted to make a copy in English and Spanish easily accessible. Please find the links to copies below.</description>

      <title>Send a fax from the command line with Python and Phaxio</title>

      <description>If you want to send a simple fax quickly, cheaply, and painlessly, Phaxio and Python make a nice combo. Below is a litte script that I wrote, based on this Ruby script by Pete Keen that is slightly out of date. There are Phaxios Python libraries, but I ran into a couple issues, and this seems to be the most brain-dead simple solution. Pros: No external dependencies. Cons: It uses the shell=True parameter for subprocess.</description>

      <description>As a computer science graduate student at Brigham Young University, I am taking CS 677: Bayesian Methods in Computer Science, which covers some aspects of using probability within computer science, as you probably guessed from its title. The required textbook for the course is Morris DeGroot&amp;rsquo;s 4th edition of Probability and Statistics, which at the time of writing this post is selling for about $170 new, $112 used on Amazon.</description>

      <description>Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking around for another domain name that&amp;rsquo;s a little shorter and more flexible than seanlane.net. My purposes for that can be explained another time, but I have been trying to search domain names that have top-level domains (the .com part of google.com, for example) that are shorter in length, alongside some other attributes. There are a number of good tools to use for searching for available domain names, but I have not found any that allow for searching by the length of top-level domain.</description>

      <description>This past semester, I had the chance to take two courses: Statistical Machine Learning from a Probabilistic Perspective (it&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a mouthful) and Big Data Science &amp;amp; Capstone. In the former, we had the chance to study the breadth of various statistical machine learning algorithms and processes that have flourished in recent years. This included a number of different topics ranging from Gaussian Mixture Models to Latent Dirichlet Allocation.</description>

      <description>Note: As of February 2018, the repo for this website is public, so I moved the comments to the same repo instead of using a separate project for them.
When I created a blog to have a place to write and document things, as well as complete a class requirement for CS 404, there were properties that I wanted it to have. I wanted it to be simple, to be hosted on a reputable platform, to be under my control, and to perform well.</description>

      <description>This post is an embedded Github Gist that I forked. I figure that since Interview season is quickly approaching, I wanted to brush up on my skills. This gist from Github user TSiege seemed like a great start, and I have added some corrections and modifications of my own. The source of this post can be found here: The Technical Interview Cheat Sheet. Please note that there is most likely a lot of errors left to find, and surely there is a lot more that can be added.</description>

      <description>I spent two years in South America where I served as a Missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in Asunción, Paraguay
My missionary service in Paraguay has been one of the defining experiences in my life. I&amp;rsquo;m very grateful for the opportunity to have met some amazing people and share a message that means the world to me. Below are some albums from different areas where I resided over the course of my two year mission.</description>

      <description>After 7 years in scouting, I achieved the rank of Eagle Scout. My project consisted of removing an existing flagpole that was too small and installing a custom made one that was twice as large. The flagpole sits adjacent to a memorial to fallen aerial firefighters outside of the Porterville Air Attack Base in Porterville, California.
An album of the project and a small article from the local newspaper about the project may be viewed at the following links:</description>

      <description>Update as of November 2018: I&amp;rsquo;ve since moved to https://sean.lane.sh, just keeping this around for sentiment&amp;rsquo;s sake.
While most definitely not the first or the last, hopefully this is a seminal moment for my own personal site. I hope to stay with seanlane.net after putting my wife through the torment of having me decide which of several domain names to settle on.
I thought sean.tl would be a nice little domain hack of my first name and initials, but it proved to be fairly confusing, as most people had no idea what the &amp;lsquo;.</description>

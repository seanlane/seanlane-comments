      <description>This post is an embedded Github Gist that I forked. I figure that since Interview season is quickly approaching, I wanted to brush up on my skills. This gist from Github user TSiege seemed like a great start, and I have added some corrections and modifications of my own. The source of this post can be found here: The Technical Interview Cheat Sheet. Please note that there is most likely a lot of errors left to find, and surely there is a lot more that can be added.</description>

### Read in 2019

* East of Eden by John Steinbeck
* Skin in the Game by Nassim Taleb

* The Ph.D. Grind: A Ph.D. Student Memoir by Philip J. Guo

### Read in 2018

	* I felt this book provides a great method of implementing a goal based lifestyle, and enables everything spoken about in Cal Newport's Deep Work
* Deep Work by Cal Newport
	* [Notes on Deep Work](/posts/2018/notes-on-deep-work)

	* I enjoy this book the more I think about it, I recommend reading it.
* Nail It, Then Scale It by Nathan R. Furr


### Read in 2017

* Stories of Your Life and Others by Ted Chiang
	* I read this after watching the movie Arrival, and I highly recommend it. The short story is enjoyable even after watching the movie (I'd argue it's better) and the other stories are great as well.

The following is mostly for my own personal reference. About 5 years ago, I worked as a technical support agent for a fairly large webhosting company that used to be located in Utah, and at the time I kept a small Wordpress site with some tips or code snippets that often came in handy. I was cleaning out soem old files, and came across the SQL dump of that site when I left that job. I'm turning them all into a post here for future reference.

## MTR - Combo of `ping` and `traceroute`

```terminal
$ mtr --report google.com

```

## Curl Debug

```terminal
$ curl --trace-ascii debugdump.txt
```

## Apache: Redirect HTTP to HTTPS

```apache
RewriteEngine On\r\nRewriteCond %{HTTPS} !on
RewriteRule (.*) <a href="https://%%7BHTTP_HOST%7D%%7BREQUEST_URI%7D" target="_BLANK">https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI}</a>
```

## Use `exigrep` to search EXIM logs

```terminal
$ sudo exigrep "email@address.com" /var/log/exim_mainlog.{14..17}.gz
```

## Change File/Folder Permissions recursively to 644/755

Source: http://rainsoftletters.wordpress.com/2008/07/22/recursively-chmodi-only-directories-or-files/

```terminal
$ find . -type d -exec chmod 755 {}
$ find . -type f -exec chmod 644 {}
```

## Recursive Terminal File Count

```terminal
$ ls -R | wc -l
```

## Debuggin WP Hacks

* Use `mtime` to see if anything was modified recently
* Use something like Sucuri, wepawet, unmasked parasites, etc for surface level hacks that are part of the discoverable file structure 

## Flush the DNS Cache in Windows or Mac

* Mac: `$ dscacheutil -flushcache`
* Windows: `$ ipconfig /flushdns`

## Count IP Addresses within an Access Log

```terminal
$ file/path/to/log.txt | cut -f1 -d '' '' | sort | uniq -c | sort -g -r | head
```

## Find files older than DAY

```terminal
$ find ./cur/* -type f -ctime +[DAY]
```

Use `-ctime` for created date and `-mtime` for last modified date. Probably be careful with this one.

## Show Disk Usage, Sorted by Size

```terminal
$ du -hs * | sort -hr
```

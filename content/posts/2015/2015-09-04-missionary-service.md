I spent two years in South America where I served as a Missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in Asunci√≥n, Paraguay

My missionary service in Paraguay has been one of the defining experiences in my life. I'm very grateful for the opportunity to have met some amazing people and share a message that means the world to me. Below are some albums from different areas where I resided over the course of my two year mission.

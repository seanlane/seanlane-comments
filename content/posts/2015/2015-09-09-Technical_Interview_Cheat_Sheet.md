This post is an embedded Github Gist that I forked. I figure that since Interview season is quickly approaching, I wanted to brush up on my skills. This gist from Github user TSiege seemed like a great start, and I have added some corrections and modifications of my own. The source of this post can be found here: [The Technical Interview Cheat Sheet](https://gist.github.com/seanlane/f5f1647deb82d4692ad6). Please note that there is most likely a lot of errors left to find, and surely there is a lot more that can be added. Feel free to fork either my copy or TSiege's original and improve upon our work. I'd love to collaborate with anyone who has any input!

## Introduction

The goal of this post is to *TODO: Flesh this out*

This has been a post that I've wanted to write for some time now, and I took a bit longer to get it fleshed out. It might also be updated from time to time, and I'll highlight any future updates here at the beginning of the post. As one of the older students, I've often found myself repeating a lot of things that I think have helped me succeed as a Computer Science student in finding good academic and professional opportunities. There is mostly some survivor bias here, and I think I have definitely been a little lucky with my past experiences, but I also believe that following the advice below has increased my exposure to opportunities like the ones that I have been privileged to be a part of.

The post itself is written from the viewpoint of a Computer Science student at Brigham Young University, and on the surface would seem to be directly written for students in my situation. With that said, I think it is also applicable to not only those outside of the Computer Science department, but also students outside of Brigham Young University, or even those outside of a collegiate environment. 

On the other hand, if you are not a Computer Science student, I would highly encourage you to take BYU CS 142 (or your local introductory programming/CS class) and see if you like it. It's a highly lucrative field that offers a lot of job satisfaction that many people don't give a try for a variety of reasons. Whether it's because you don't think you're the "computer type" (whatever that means), or that you're not smart enough, or anything, just try it. Computer skills will only become more necessary in the coming years, and you don't have to major in it. There's a BYU CS minor, and even just understanding more about how programs are created and how computers work will be a valuable skill professionally and personally. If you have any reservations about taking a Computer Science class, you have my permission to reach out via Twitter or email and I'd be glad to discuss about why that isn't a reason to not learn more about Computer Science or programming in general.

As for the rest of this post, the sections will be listed in order of importance in helping you get a great job and increase your market value.

## Get an internship

This should be your number one priority as a Computer Science student as of 2017. You could do nothing else described in this post, and you would still most likely be very employable by virtue of having previous experience as an intern for a reputable organization. Of course, there are always exceptions to every rule, and it isn't an all or nothing thing, but by and large, having an internship is the best thing you can do to prepare yourself to work as a software engineer/developer/maestro. 

* Go to the career fair



As a freshman or sophomore student, there are a number of internships at the time of writing that are focused towards underclassmen:

*TODO*: List these out

If you are part of a minority group, there are also a number of internships focused towards you as well:

Of course, getting an internship it


## Personal Preparation



## Effective Education

Goals
Don't let school get in the way of education
Do good work 

## Network

Networking is a oft repeated term among those counseling students who are looking for employment, but I feel like it can be a bit vague as to how to go about it.

Congratulations, you found my wishlist! The purpose of this page is two-fold:

1. To remember things I need/want to get
2. To help family members with gift ideas, which I have been told can be somewhat difficult for me


Note that the links or the models given are for pictures / specifying the model, or rather to give the general idea or impression of what I had in mind. It doesn't mean I'm looking for that specific thing, and I wouldn't refuse something bought elsewhere, of course. Aside from grouping by sections, there is not much importance given to order. The items are generally listed in the order added to this list within their specific groups. Items that are ~~crossed out~~ have already been attained and are left for future ideas :).

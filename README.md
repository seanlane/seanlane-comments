# Sean Lane's Personal Website

I've based my website on the [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) project, which uses Jekyll to generate the static web pages. **Jekyll** is a static site generator that's perfect for GitHub hosted blogs ([Jekyll Repository](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll))
